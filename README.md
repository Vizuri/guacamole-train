Support scripts and info for using Guacamole and Train

During a train lab startup a few files are created that can be processed and used to assist in setting up a Guacamole server if necessary.

A users directory is created by train and then directories created for each user.
Within each directory is a file that contains each instance started for that user.

Importing/processing the train generated directories/files can then be done to make it easier to configure a Guacamole server for the train created environment.
